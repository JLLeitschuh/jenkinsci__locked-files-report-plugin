    There has been reports with the Windows handle tool that it does not timeout due to an unknown issue. To make sure that the
    build continues even if the tool locks up it is possible to set a timeout. The timeout is specified in minutes and should be
    long enough to let the tool finish normally. Default value is 10 minutes, and 0 minutes means that the tool will not timeout and may
    hang the build. This was introduced to fix the <a href="https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-4797">JENKINS-4797</a> issue
    and has only occurred on Windows.
